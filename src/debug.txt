-- fails need to be on a different graph (num of convex vs num of nonconvex)
-- compare langrange convexity to my convexity i currently use the objective function but there is a library function
for the lagrange convexity. which should i trust more if they are different?
-- need to make a benchmarking set by factoring out the globally convex problems that have solutions from the library
-- Things I need to check with the benchmarking:
--- the solutions
--- general bugs such as value errors or float errors - inconsistent constraint errors
--- type 2 constraints in general - maybe seperate the files so that i test type 1 and 2 seperately.
--- assume the bug is on my end until it is provably not

--- for the benchmarking set add descriptions and number of variables
--- need well known problems for benchmarking
--- gams model library for examples
